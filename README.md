# gorun - A distributed job scheduling system

I am considering preparing this code for a more general release. At this point the code should be considering version 0.1.0 and subject to change. The code is not yet ready for general use.

With that caveat, this code has worked for me in a production environment, and anyone is free to fork this repo to use as a starting place.
